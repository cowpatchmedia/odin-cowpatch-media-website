Cowpatch Media's Website for The Odin Project

This was a web design challenge from the Odin Project based around "the holy grail"
HTML format. 

In this excercise, I built a website with multiple flexbox containers and website
elements using HTML, CSS and flexbox principles. The website has the ability to show
information in a simple format with links to other webpages. 

There is still more to learn, mainly how to make the website responsive to smaller or
larger monitors. on small monitors the project looks good, but is a bit spread out on
larger monitors.
